I’d like to start with a question from one of our readers. Who influenced you musically as you were growing up?

I listened to the radio, and I listened to whatever my parents listened to, from the forties through the nineties. In high school, I liked Dave Matthews band, G. Love ＆ Special Sauce, Soul Coughing, and Ani DeFranco. Then I learned who they liked, and I discovered Bob Dylan, Neil Young and James Taylor. But I never feel like I can answer this question completely, because music discovery isn’t finite.
