            That sounds likes great advice. Jason, I know you walk the talk about living consciously. Could you tell us a little about some philanthropic initiatives you’re passionate about?

            Closest to my heart is a program in my hometown of Richmond, Virginia called Live Art. The program is hosted by The School of Performing Arts in the Richmond Community, and it nurtures the talents of individuals with special needs. It culminates with an extraordinary live concert in which students perform the content they created during the year. Performers Sara Bareilles and KD Lang were guest stars for the first two seasons. My hope is that this groundbreaking program will be replicated across the country. It’s been amazing to watch transformations occur not only with the students but also within the community that stands behind it.<br>
            Another program I support is Kiss the Ground, based in southern California. Their mission is to educate others, especially young people and future farmers, about the importance of soil health and how to improve it. Fundamentally, how we treat our soil is how we treat ourselves, since our health depends on mineral-rich foods that come from the earth. And what’s more, the climate crisis our planet is facing can be reversed through our soil, because properly cultivated soil can actually reduce the carbon in the atmosphere.<br>
            Along these lines, I also encourage people to buy food that has been grown locally rather than unconsciously consuming products from overseas. Buying locally helps you understand where things come from. In fact, the UN recently released a report that the future will be fed by local urban farms, so we might as well be the generation to start it.<br>
            We need millions of farmers right now to replace retiring farmers. If we don’t inspire people to farm, we could end up being forced to eat processed, factory-farmed food. It really is a crisis situation. But at the same time, there is a good food revolution happening. Our generation wants fresh, healthy, organic food. Hopefully, that demand will inspire future farmers to become environmentally savvy and soil-conscious. In the meantime, as individuals, we can supplement our grocery purchases by growing a few things, even on our balconies or decks.  If everyone did this, it would make a huge impact.
