            I think that the secret to improving the world is consuming less and living more simply. We need to mindfully avoid buying pointless stuff and eating unhealthy food, because all of that consumption ultimately uses natural resources. The more natural resources we consume, the more we suffocate our host organism, the Earth. But if we’re present about our consumption, we save not only money and natural resources, but also time and energy. In turn, we have that time and energy to fulfill our dreams and work on projects that are close to our hearts. So we need to be present about our consumption, especially of food and energy. That’s a huge way we can have an impact on the world.
