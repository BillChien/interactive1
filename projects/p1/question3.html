            Let’s talk about your music. Your latest album, “YES!,” is acoustic. What was the inspiration behind the album?

            It all started in my backyard, and for that reason this album is the most personal-sounding album that I’ve made. I met my collaborators, Raining Jane, about eight years ago at a gig. I invited them to my house, and we immediately started to write music. And we made this music simply out of love for each other and love for the sound.
