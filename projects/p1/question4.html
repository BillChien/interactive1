            My collaborators and I found that we shared a common passion among the five of us, which is, to put it in your magazine’s perspective, consciousness. We love to write songs that remind us to be present: to forgive others and ourselves, to be compassionate, and even to remind us about environmental stewardship. The album we created follows that theme. And we wanted the songs to be transformational, to encourage others to improve the quality of their lives. After all, life is an inside job, and our own thoughts, our speech, our actions, our attitudes, and our beliefs determine our life experience.<br>
            To sequence the album, I thought about the process I use when I put a set list together. When you create a set list, you want there to be purpose for the songs you’re playing. Sometimes you set a song up by telling a story, but sometimes you can just set it up with the song before it, and that’s what I tried to do on the album. We wanted to take the listeners on a journey, and then return ourselves and the listeners to the present.
