            Never forget that music is the reward. If you feel like something’s missing, turn back to the music and remember how much music has given you already, and how much it can give you in the moment.<br>
            And as far as finding a career path for it, don’t wait for anybody to hand it to you; it has to stem out of your joy. It’s through sharing your joy that people are going to want your music. I always recommend that a new artist just go somewhere and play. Find a favorite location, and then stay put. Don’t wander all over the city and be hard to track down. Find a street corner, find your YouTube channel, find your venue, find where you’re happiest, and share your joy.
